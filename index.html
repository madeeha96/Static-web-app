                <h3> Rich Internet Applications </h3>
                <p> Applications today are much more complex than they used to be. A typical web application has to work across
                    a number of different browsers, devices, form factors, perform processing on the front end and the back
                    end, track performance and usage data and be secure. With technology evolving quickly, expectations are
                    higher than ever.</p>
